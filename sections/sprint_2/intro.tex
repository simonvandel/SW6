The goal of this sprint is to continue work on the prototype, based on requirements determined through the first sprint. In order to further validate if the prototype satisfies the users needs, another meeting will be established at the end of the sprint. The prototype should be a vertical prototype including basic functionality, but still focus on the representational requirements. The sprint will also cover technical details regarding implementation of geodetic considerations. The meeting at the end of the sprint will include a demonstration of the prototype.
