\subsection{Summary}

We saw in this section, how kernel density estimation can be used to estimate the crowd factors, we wish to visualise for the users of the system. While we must remember that this is only estimation, we consider it to be a precise one. The mathematical definitions of the crowd factors was introduced and integrated with the kernel density estimation.

We also found that choosing the bandwidth is a very important step in the process. While we were unable to settle on a bandwidth, we showed how it can be deducted from a data set. This technique can be implemented, such that once a representative data set is available, we can adjust the bandwidth accordingly.

But a problem still remains. While these formulae might give us the answer we are looking for, we need to consider how they can be implemented in a web application where users expect to have the analysis done in real-time.
