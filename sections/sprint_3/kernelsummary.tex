\subsection{Summary}

We saw in this section how kernel density estimation can be used to estimate the crowd factors, that we wish to visualise for the users of the system. The mathematical definitions of the crowd factors was introduced and integrated with the kernel density estimation.

We also showed that the accuracy of the estimation is highly dependent on the bandwidth. While we were unable to settle on a bandwidth, we showed how it can be deduced from a data set. This technique can be implemented, such that once a representative data set is available, we can adjust the bandwidth accordingly.

While these formulae might give us the mathematical solutions, we still need to consider how they can be implemented in a web application where users expect to have the analysis done in real-time.
