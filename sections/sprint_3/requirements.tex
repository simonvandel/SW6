\section{Requirements Specification} \label{sec:s3_requirements}
% Update intro.....
During the user test with Alarm HS, several new use cases we identified. For the application to support these new use cases, additional requirements will be added to the previous requirements from \cref{sec:s2_reqs}.

\subsection{Additional Users} \label{ss:s3_users}
Along with the additional use cases, we also identified new users for the system. 
% Users: festical guest, guards, medical personnel

% add use cases

\subsection{Revised Requirements} \label{ss:s2_reqs}
Based on the new use cases several additional functional requirements have been identified, which must be added to the requirements previously identified in \cref{ss:s2_update_reqs}. The following requirements will be added:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{A map legend.} In order to make the crowd information overlays more intuitive, a map legend explaining the overlays must be added. This is very important for a usable system, and will be prioritised as must have.
    \item \emph{Multiple access levels.} The system must have multiple access levels, such that information and features can be targeted at the relevant users. This is important for the system, is prioritised as must have.
    \item \emph{Adding of markers at specific locations.} These markers could be used to contain information of incidents, and should be visible to all relevant users. This is prioritised as should have.
    \item \emph{A help feature.} The application should have a help feature that explains the applications functionalities. This is prioritised as should have.
    \item \emph{Send notification to other users.} It could be possible for some users with a sufficient access level to send notification to other users. This is prioritised as could have.
    \item \emph{A menu with searchable contact information.} A menu containing the contact information of the festival employees. It should be possible to search through the contacts. This is prioritised as won't have, as it is not important for the usability of the application.
    \item \emph{Reporting of incidents by festival guests.} It could be possible for festival guests to access the application, and report an incident on the map. This requirement is not in the scope of the project, and is prioritised as won't have.
\end{enumerate}

Updating the previous requirements specification from \cref{tab:s2_req} gives us the requirement specification shown in \cref{tab:s3_req}.

No non-functional requirements are added in this sprint, so the non-functional requirements are still given by \cref{tab:s2_nreqs}.

% Or is this a non-functional requirement?? TBD
\textbf{Should have}
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
    
    \item \textbf{[Added]} All data displayed to the user could also be stored for later retrieval, allowing for analysis of a problematic situation, which could improve the ability to handle similar future situations.
    
\end{enumerate}
