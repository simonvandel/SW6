\section{Kernel Theory}
\label{sec:kernelTheory}
In order to be able to visualise the crowd factors introduced in \cref{sec:related_work} we must analyse the position data and then estimate the local crowd factors. This section will first explain how kernel density estimation is used in the context of this project. Afterwards, we explain how this approach can be used to estimate the crowd factors. Lastly we will discuss the bandwidth variable, how to find it, and how it impacts our project.
