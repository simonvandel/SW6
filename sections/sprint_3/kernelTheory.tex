\section{Kernel Density Estimation}
\label{sec:kernelDensityEstimation}
In order to analyse position data and derive the crowd conditions we wish to observe, we need to find the estimated crowd factors introduced in \cref{sec:related_work}. This section will first explain how kernel density estimation is used to estimate the local crowd density. Afterwards, we explain how this approach can be extended to estimation of the crowd factors. Lastly we will discuss the bandwidth variable, how to find it, and how it impacts our project.
