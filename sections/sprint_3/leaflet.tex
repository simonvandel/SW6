\subsection{Customized Visualisation}\label{sec:own_leaflet_plugin}

Up till this point we have used multiple different Leaflet plug-in libraries for visualisation. These libraries were however not adequately flexible for the data we have to visualise. We therefore created our own Leaflet plug-in, giving us the ability to tailor the visualisations to our needs.

Every Leaflet plug-in library we explored has its own assumptions on how data should be visualised, and none of those assumption satisfied our needs. For example, all libraries use a global scaling of densities, meaning the density visualisation of a point depends on the density of other points. Additionally, we had no control over the shapes used in the visualisations.

Because of this, we decided to create our own Leaflet plug-in based on Leaflet.heat. The goal of this plug-in is to allow us to experiment with different visualisation techniques more freely. By creating our own plug-in, we have complete control of how the data is drawn on the map. This means that we can render the visualisations in a very specific fashion that suits our needs.
