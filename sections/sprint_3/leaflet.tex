\subsection{Crowd Conditions Visualisation Rendering}\label{sec:own_leaflet_plugin}
\kanote{udvid dette afsnit}
Up till this point we have used the Leaflet library for visualisation, but this library was not adequately flexible for the data they had to visualise.

Because of this, we decided to create our own Leaflet plug-in based on Leaflet.heat. The goals of this plug-in is to allow us to experiment with different visualisation techniques. By creating our own plug-in, we have complete control of how the data is drawn on the map. Additionally, we can decide what units the weights of the drawn points are.
