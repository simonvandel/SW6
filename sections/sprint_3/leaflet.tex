\subsection{Crowd Conditions Visualisation Rendering}\label{sec:own_leaflet_plugin}
\kanote{udvid dette afsnit}

Up till this point we have used different Leaflet plug-in libraries for visualisation, but these libraries are not adequately flexible for the data we have to visualise. We therefore create our own Leaflet plug-in, giving us more flexibility in tailoring visualisations to our needs.

Every Leaflet plug-in library we tried has its own assumption on how the data should be visualised, and this assumption does not satisfy our needs. For example, all libraries used a global scaling of densities, meaning the density of a point depends on the density of other points. Additionally, we had no control over the shapes used in the visualisations.

Because of this, we decided to create our own Leaflet plug-in based on Leaflet.heat. The goals of this plug-in is to allow us to experiment with different visualisation techniques. By creating our own plug-in, we have complete control of how the data is drawn on the map. This means that we can render the visualisations in a very specific fashion that suits our needs.
