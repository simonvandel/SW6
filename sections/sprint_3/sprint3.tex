\chapter{Third Sprint}\label{ch:sprint3}

This chapter covers the development done during the third sprint, which is primarily concerned with the system's analytical ability. During this chapter we explain how we use kernel estimation to calculate the crowd factors that were introduced during the first sprint. Afterwards we cover the design of the analyser, which is the software module that executes the kernel estimation of the crowd factors. Then at the end we discuss implementation of this module, and briefly touch on implementation of visualisation. Unlike the other sprints, we do not conclude this sprint based on a meeting with Alarm HS of SmukFest, but instead do internal assessment of the analytical ability of the system.
