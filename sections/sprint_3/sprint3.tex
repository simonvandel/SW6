\chapter{Third Sprint}\label{ch:sprint3}

This chapter covers the development done during the third sprint, which is primarily about the systems analytical ability. During this chapter we will explain how we use kernel estimation to calculate the crowd conditions that were introduced during the first sprint. Afterwards we will explain the design of the analyser, which is the software module that will execute the kernel estimation of the crowd conditions. Then at the end we will discuss implementation of this module. Unlike the other sprints, we will not conclude this sprint based on a meeting with Alarm HS of SmukFest, but will instead do internal assessment of the analytical ability of the system.
