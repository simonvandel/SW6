\chapter{Meeting Summaries}
This appendix contains summaries of all the meetings held with potential users during the project. Summaries are provided in place of transcriptions, as the interviews were all conducted in Danish and had long durations. Sound recordings of the interviews are available on the supplied CD, except for the interview with the security officer at SmukFest, summary in \cref{app:smukfest_security_officer}, as this interview contained confidential information.
