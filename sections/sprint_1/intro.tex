%% Chapter intro
This chapter describes the development done during the first sprint in the project. During this sprint we start by defining a list of requirements for the system. These requirements leads to an exploration of related work within the field of crowd monitoring, which could be useful for this project. Based on the requirements and the information gathered, an initial prototype of the system is developed. This prototype is then subjected to testing by potential users, during which we also try to gain a better understanding of which functionality potential users could want. Finally we conclude on the development during the sprint, along with the usability of the prototype.
