%%% Contents/walk-through of the chapter
We start the sprint by reconsidering the requirements identified in the previous sprint. Following this is a description of the structure of the model layer in the application, and implementation choices concerning the performance of the system. We then consider the design of the visualisation of crowd factors, and finally we perform a user acceptance test of the system.
