%%% Contents/walk-through of the chapter
We start the sprint by reconsidering the requirements identified in the previous sprint. Following this the structure of the model component\lanote{layer/thingy/?} is described, and implementation choices concerning the performance of the system. We then consider the design of the visualisation of crowd factors, and finally we perform a user acceptance test of the system.
