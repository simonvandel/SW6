\section{Class Architecture}

In order to describe the structure design of the HotMap server, the UML v2.5 standard is used to express how the class hierarchy was designed. UML is a well known modelling language, for visualising software system designs in order to more easily describe the static structure of a software system.
Therefore a UML class diagram is used for describing the model layer of the HotMap server.
