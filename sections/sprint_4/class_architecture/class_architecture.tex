\section{Class Architecture}

During this sprint an effort was made towards matching the architecture of the application to the design choices made during the previous sprint. In this section the result of that work will be described and explained. This is done with a class diagram. Significant classes will be further explained in text. Since the application is implemented in the Scala language, the section will begin with an explanation of certain features which might not be considered common in the object oriented paradigm.
