% Motivation for our specific problem
Our group belongs to the application super-group, and as such our focus is on developing an application that provides \gls{lbs} through the use of the aSTEP core platform. Due to the large application area of LBS, the problem domain have to be limited. 

An area of particular interest is using \gls{lbs} to monitor the behavior of crowds at certain events, namely events that attract large crowds. While these events can control the total number of people entering the premises, large crowds can still pose many different problems for the event organisers. This is, amongst other reasons, due to the unpredictable movements that happens in areas with large crowds~\cite{wirz2012inferring}. The problem is complicated further at some events, where it is not feasible for the security personnel to manually monitor the entire area at once. 

% Problem statement
Therefore a \gls{lbs} application might be able to assist in the monitoring task, by gathering information about the positions and movement of the individuals in the crowd, through their mobile devices. This leads us to the problem statement for this project:
