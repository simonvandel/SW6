The ever increasing popularity of mobile technology means an increasingly large percentage of the population in many countries use smartphones, tablets, and laptops~\cite{techcrunch_mobile_usage}. This still increasing ubiquity of mobile technology with positioning systems has resulted in a rising interest in software development in areas such as \gls{lbs}~\cite{dey2010location}. 

\gls{lbs} is a term that describes services that utilise knowledge of the users position, in order to improve the functionality available to the application users. \gls{lbs} applications are very popular today, and are used widely for many different purposes, by an increasing amount of people~\cite[1-2]{schiller2004location}. Typical examples of the usage of \gls{lbs} include navigation applications and applications for identifying nearby events or points of interest. Due to this increasing interest in \gls{lbs}, Aalborg University has started the aSTEP multi-project. 

\jenote{Do we want to focus on LBS in the project introduction?? I was thinking more crowd safety? Or is this the introduction for the aSTEP collaboration?)}
