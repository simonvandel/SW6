Mobile technology is very widespread today, where an increasingly large percentage of the population in many countries use smartphones, tablets, and laptops~\cite{techcrunch_mobile_usage}. This still increasing ubiquity of mobile technology has resulted in an increasing interest in software development in areas such as \gls{lbs}~\cite{dey2010location}. 

\gls{lbs} is a term that describes services that utilise knowledge of the users position, in order to improve the functionality available to the application users. \gls{lbs} applications are very popular today, and are used widely for many different purposes, by an increasing amount of people~\cite[pp. 1-2]{schiller2004location}. Typical examples of the usage of \gls{lbs} include navigation applications and applications for identifying nearby events or points of interest.
