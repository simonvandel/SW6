\section{Report Structure} \label{sec:report_structure}
% Motivation --> study regulations
The study regulation emphasize the importance of using well defined software development methods and practices during the development of a complex software system, where many sub-projects have to be coordinated. In order to better reflect the development process followed in the project and the coordination challenges, the report has been structured as follows:

\textbf{Chapter 1:} The introduction chapter, where we introduce the motivation behind the problem, as well as the aSTEP project.

\textbf{Chapters 2-5:} In these chapters, one for each sprints, we describe the development and research done in each sprint individually.

\textbf{Chapter 6:} In this chapter we describe the most important collaborations we have had with the other aSTEP groups during the semester. 

\textbf{Chapter 7:} The final chapter, where we evaluate the entire project, including the developed system, collaborations, and the development process. We also discuss relevant future work on the system.
