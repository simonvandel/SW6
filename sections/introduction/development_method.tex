% Agile development
In order to facilitate inter-group collaboration, our project follows a similar development process to that of the aSTEP multi-project, that is an agile process divided into four sprints. This development process also suits the nature of the project well, as the requirements are not clearly defined early in the project and are expected to be subject to changes during the development process.

% Requirements engineering
To account for requirements changing we start each sprint by reevaluating the requirements from the previous sprint. This method is used in combination with an evolutionary prototyping approach, with an initial prototype developed in the first sprint. In subsequent sprints this prototype is refined, improving existing functionality, and adding new functionality as required, based on the updated requirement specification. Each sprint concludes with an evaluation of the prototype at that time, in the form of a user test or performance test. This evaluation then forms the basis for the refinement of the requirements in the next sprint. 

% Version control - maybe here? maybe in aSTEP section? maybe nowhere at all?
