\section{Ethics \& Malicious Usage}
Since this system is effectively able to display real-time positions of people, ethical issues and potential malicious usage have to be considered before the system should be used. 

If the system is receiving location data using Wi-Fi triangulation, positions of users can be recorder without user's consent. The tracking of users without their knowledge is a big ethical issue.

Malicious usage of the system can expose sensitive information about individuals. Although we do not receive information from the aSTEP project that can directly be used to identify individuals, it is possible to infer the identity of individuals using auxiliary information. For example, by combining knowledge about an individual's music taste, one can cross reference the location of all positions with specific music performances at a festival. Another potential issue in this system is finding individuals who appear to be alone in a area. 

% usefulness of the system
\section{Usefulness of The System}
%% data -router requirements (WIFI) OR gps data
%% accuracy of data
%% pressure and turbulence was not intuitive. Is it even possible to make it intuitive? Can it get too high level, such that expert users can not use the system efficiently?
