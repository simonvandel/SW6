Crowd safety personnel at large events experience a great challenge in avoiding crowd disasters. This project describes the motivation, design and implementation of a system useful for identifying crowd conditions at large events. The problem statement of the project is as follows:

% problem statement
\textbf{\textit{How can we develop an application that, using aSTEP services, can analyse position data gathered from events that attracts large crowds, identify relevant information about the behaviour of the crowds, and present this information to event staff in an intuitive manner?}}

% approach
First, we define the concepts of crowd conditions and crowd factors. These factors are presented in a prototype shown to multiple organisations throughout the project. Valuable feedback is iteratively processed into requirements during four sprints.

We develop an algorithm for real-time analysis of location data, gathered in the aSTEP location based service platform. The core of the algorithm is the kernel density estimation method. The results of the analysis is visualised on a map-based web service.

% results
The system is evaluated in a user acceptance test, which showed that half of the overlays were appreciate, while the remaining two overlays were difficult to understand.
